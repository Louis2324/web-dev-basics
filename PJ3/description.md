# Week Three: **CSS Layout Patterns with Flex and Grid**

This week, we’re diving into the layout patterns that power real-world, visually impressive websites. These patterns aren’t just “nice to know” they’re the building blocks you’ll use to craft clean, modern, and responsive designs.

**CSS layout patterns** are essentially the blueprints for arranging your page content. Once you understand them, you can remix, tweak, and invent your own layouts with confidence.

In this repo, we’ll explore some of the most *fundamental, widely-used, and surprisingly fun* layout techniques:

1. **Multi-column Layout** – Perfect for splitting content into readable, newspaper-style columns.
2. **Holy Grail Layout** – The classic header/content/sidebar/footer combo that every developer ends up building.
3. **Masonry Layout** – That Pinterest-style “organized chaos” grid that looks dynamic and artsy.
4. **Grid Layouts** – The powerhouse of CSS: flexible, responsive, and infinitely customizable.

By the end of the week, you’ll be able to understand these patterns—and more importantly—bend them to your will. Let’s build some beautifully structured pages!
