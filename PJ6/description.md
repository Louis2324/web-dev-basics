# **Week 7 : Building apps using apis** 
---

This week we'll focus on building web apps that actually take data from different sources and display them in an according layout 

# Project Structure

```bash
  /_quote
  /_weather
```

*Quote* is a the source code for a random project generator app , using asynchronous javascript and the fetch function to make api calls , this give a layout for the basics and lays out the ground for the next project.

*Weather* is the bigger project here , it'll encompass using real world data for display in a meaningfull and effective way , mixing layouts and frontend design with logical data structure.
